The source of the word "pie" may be the magpie, a "bird known for collecting odds and ends in its nest";
the connection could be that Medieval pies also contained many different animal meats, including chickens, crows, pigeons and rabbits.
[2] One 1450 recipe for “grete pyes” that is suggested as support for the "magpie" etymology contained what
Charles Perry called "odds and ends", including: "...beef, beef suet, capons, hens, both mallard and teal ducks, rabbits, woodcocks and
large birds such as herons and storks, plus beef marrow, hard-cooked egg yolks, dates, raisins and prunes.
